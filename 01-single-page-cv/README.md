# Single Page CV: Fast, Semantic, and Shareable

This repository is a learning project implemented as a challenge from the Roadmap.sh Frontend Roadmap. The goal was to build a highly performant, accessible, and easily shareable Single Page CV while practicing core frontend fundamentals.

- Purpose: Practice HTML semantics, metadata (Open Graph), and minimal, fast markup.
- Challenge source: Frontend Roadmap by Roadmap.sh (see Project URL below).

## What I learned / Focus areas

- HTML Semantics: Use of structural elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` to improve accessibility and maintainability.
- Metadata & Open Graph: Proper use of `<meta>` and OG tags to control link previews on social platforms.
- Performance & Simplicity: Demonstrating how a minimal pure-HTML approach can be fast and portable.

## Open Graph (OG) Tags & Metadata

**Open Graph (OG) tags** are the unseen powerhouse for link sharing. While often overlooked, they are absolutely **essential for controlling how your content appears on social platforms** (Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack). By properly setting tags like `og:title`, `og:image`, and `og:description`, we guarantee the shared link snippet is professional.

## HTML Semantics

**Good semantics** are the backbone of a high-quality website. By intentionally using descriptive structural tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) instead of generic `<div>`s, this project achieves three key benefits:

1.  **Accessibility:** It provides a clear, logical navigation path for screen readers.
2.  **SEO:** It makes the content more easily readable and indexable by search bots.
3.  **Maintainability:** The code becomes more readable and easier for developers to work with.
